# About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm David, a programmer analyst, and professional problem solver based in the Bay Area, California.


_**Professionally**_, I optimize data pipelines, build automated reporting tools, manage user access for thousands of users in an ever increasingly cloud-centric environment.

_**Personally**_, I'm a tinkerer by trade. I love messing around with operating systems, particularly of the GNU/Linux variety. I use [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) btw.

## üéØ Philosophy

I believe:
- The products you buy are **yours**, and [you should be able to fix them yourself](https://www.repair.org/stand-up), and use them as you please. If buying isnt owning, then [what kind of society do we live in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom)?
- AI is coming. You shouldn't rely on some other guys' AI, you should [run your own](https://ollama.com/).
- NVIDIA is cool and all, but [fully open source drivers are better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ&rco=1).
- Blockchain technology is the future. I think like everyone else, I just don't know how. Lets just get a couple things straight:
    - [Web3 is _usually_ a scam, but can be used for good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2_EeEo7kwY).
    - Cryptocurrency will not be commonly accepted as a payment type until governments figure out how to [track and tax individual transactions](https://www.irs.gov/filing/digital-assets). 
    - Diversification of your portfolio is still better. [_TLDR;_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) don't freebase crypto.
