Hi again all, it is indeed me again.<br>

In this post I would like to discuss the elephant in the room that seems to be getting ignored by the tech-bros of LinkedIn, but first I would like to draw an analogy to the infamous Spongebob Squarepants villain: Dirty Bubble.
The inside joke here is that Dirty Bubble is a fart bubble, floating around the ocean, and trapping it's enemies inside exposing them to it's noxious fumes.<br>

I know what you're thinking. <br>

_"Is this guy's first post on his blog seriously going to talk about farts."_ <br>

**Yes**. Yes, it is.<br>

Dirty Bubble's super ability is that it grows when it eats up more victims. It's influence expands. It's reign of terror usually comes to an end when some rational character realizes that it's just a normal bubble with a thin membrane, and can be easily popped with a pointy object. <br>

We are undoubtedly within a technological bubble created by AI hype. To be completely honest, if you disagree you are either completely delusional or you have no idea what the underlying problem actually is. Placing all of the moral and ethical concerns of AI aside, at least in this blog post, I am for now focusing on the economic concerns of the bubble that persists. <br>

Going back to the Dirty Bubble, I going to break the underlying parties up to fit my analogy.

**1. The bubble itself**

As previously stated, the bubble is the AI Hype. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of reasons to be excited for and rooting for the success of AI technology. I truly believe AI is one of the most important technological innovations in my lifetime thus far. Where I am skeptical, are the intentions behind the development of the AI models, and the scale at which the bet has grown. To figure who is making this bet, we need to look deeper at the parties that stand to gain the most from AI's success. Let's move on to who is letting this one rip.


**2. The farter(s)**

The farter in this case depends on your perspective. You could believe that it's the inventors of the AI's to blame, and that Geoffrey Hinton was the farter for thinking of the first artificial neural network. While his ideas and creations certainly are responsible for the conceptualization of AI,   I would argue that at the time of creating the first artificial neural network, he did not exactly know _what_ he was creating, or that his invention would be taken in the direction it inevitably did. I believe a much stronger argument is that the bubble is not just one person (or entity's) fart, but rather a collection of several large farts joined together. I am of course talking about the companies producing the LLM's.<br>

For the sake of the argument, I think it's really important to take a step back and figure out why all of these large corporations are pushing AI on the general public so much. As of writing this, they are beyond trying to convince the average person to use AI more, but are actively implementing it in every product possible, no matter how pointless. Why though? It's because of the nature of data collection practices. You can only dredge so much information about someone by tracking what websites they visit, what links they click, and who's social media posts they react to. If you shove an AI agent into everything you can get a far more intimate picture of the ways a person uses your product, even down to the seemingly mundane details. They've gone beyond just collecting data on your shopping patterns, and feeding you recommendations on what you should buy next. They want to know _why_ you're interested in buying that particular dress in that particular color. They want to know that Casio watches are very special to you because your father gifted you one when you were a child and you've worn one on your wrist ever since. Storing all of this data to track the _why_ for all of these people is exorbitantly expensive, and is going to take **many** more data centers. These data centers cost billions of dollars each to construct and consume as much electricity as a small city. The issue here should speak for itself, but now also consider what the maintenance costs of these facilities looks like. <br>

To solve the problem of generating more compute to process all of this data, the only other option is to find a way to make the chips in the preexisting data centers more efficient and at a faster and faster rate. NVIDIA has given very muddy estimates on what the turnover of their AI chips is going to be, but you don't need to be a PhD researcher in Moore's Law to see that even if NVIDIA pumps their newest chips out on a cadence of every 3 years that will still incur an _enormous_ cost on replacing the old chips. <br>

Undoudtedly, the farter's are the companies perpetuating, and weirdly necessitating, all of the AI hype like our very existance depends on it. And, my dear reader, it is indeed a very smelly and wet one. To tie this back together we must next examine who stands to lose the most.<br>

**3. The victims**

Sticking to my promise of keeping the discussion on the economic perspective, the victims in this case are all those swept up in the economic wake of AI. I'm not even talking about all of the supposed "AI related layoffs," but rather the unfortunate fact that all of this wealth is being siphoned off and pushed into something that is a massive gamble. We're witnessing a pokermatch between some of the largest players in our economy, and they all have really shitty cards. The difference in this card match is there is no winner, because they're all playing with borrowed money. What they are gambling with are our 401k's, our pensions, our utility bills, our environment, and even our dignity. When the bubble inevitably bursts, we may be free of the bubble, but all those trapped inside are still going to smell like fart. Even for all those that were not trapped in the bubble, they will still need to deal with many people around them smelling like fart.<br>

**"Hey wait... What's the 'needle' in this analogy?"**

That's the multi-trillion dollar question. My answer to that is: who cares? We're already stuck inside this fart with no easy way out. Everything smells like fart, and we have billionaires and corporations trying to tell us it smells good. <br>

Think about it. When you read about historical event's of economic collapse are you concerned with studying the events the moment the collapse occurs, or are you trying to develop a hindsight understanding of how it happened in the first place?<br>
